    title: "Our Story",
    body : "We started devSEAL Technologies because we believed that the best and brightest product engineers can come from anywhere in the world, including Africa. We had been through the rigorous West African Education System in the 90's that prepared us for successful and rewarding careers in Europe and the United States.",
    sub: "Our vision was simple, build a team that is uncompromising to the mission of shifting the center of gravity of tech to Africa, and in doing so, change the prospects of millions of Africa's youth.Since launching and with the hiring of \" The Elite Eight '' (devSEAL's first 8 Engineers), we have begun to build world-class digital solutions for international corporate customers out of Lagos, Nigeria. Our faith in Africa's youth has been rewarded, the spirit of excellence, dedication and hard work shines through each SEAL as they engage with clients near and far.We will continue to grow and add more SEAL's to the team to meet the demands of the mission, what will not change, is that African spirit that pushes us to succeed. The same spirit that makes Africans successful in foreign lands will make Africa successful today and tomorrow. "
